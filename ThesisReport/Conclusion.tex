This project presents a promising solution to one of healthcare's most pressing challenges: promoting patient engagement in their care and the timeliness, relevance, and confidentiality of their health information. Thus, using the advanced RAG systems with additional large language models, we hope to provide a system that helps patients be more aware of their medical histories and help the doctors and nurses quickly access crucial information.

The integration of external knowledge sources through vector databases ensures that the responses generated are not only contextually relevant but also grounded in factual, certified information, minimising the risks of AI hallucinations. Furthermore, the project places a significant focus on data privacy and regulatory compliance, ensuring that all interactions with the system adhere to DISHA\cite{Ganapathy} and DPDPA\@\cite{SundaraNarendran+2023+129+141} standards, making it suitable for real-world deployment in hospital environments.
