The primary goal of this thesis is to employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLM) to build an AI-assisted healthcare communication system to improve the experience of the patient/healthcare provider relationship. The proposed system targets to solve major issues arising from information seeking and sharing in the healthcare domain, enabling patients and providers to effectively and efficiently acquire context-specific results. The points for the objective are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve Patient Access to Medical Information
    \item Streamline Data Retrieval for Healthcare Providers
    \item Mitigate Hallucinations and Enhance Reliability
    \item Ensure Data Privacy and Compliance
    \item Incorporate Human-in-the-Loop Mechanisms
\end{itemize}
