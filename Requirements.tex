For this project, simulating the development and testing environment for the RAG-based LLM healthcare system requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling AI model training, retrieval systems, and large data processing. Below are the key requirements and platforms that will be employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programming Languages and Frameworks: Python, LangChain, FastAPI 
    \item Models: LLaMA, Mistral, Nemotron
    \item Vector Database: Pinecone
    \item Cloud Infrastructure: AWS EC2 and S3 Buckets
    \item Security and Compliance: Implement OAuth 2.0 and IAM
    \item Testing Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Postman
    \item User Interface: Reactjs (web version)
\end{itemize}
